# OpenWorlds ActiveWorlds import tools

This repository contains miscelaneous tools and documentation for getting ActiveWorld data imported into OpenWorlds. Very much a work in progress, many things here might end up being integrated into OpenWorlds, or just exist as external tools / documentation.

Any and all contributions welcome ;)
