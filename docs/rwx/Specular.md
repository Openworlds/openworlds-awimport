# Specular
### Usage
    Specular value
### Description
This command sets the specular component of the current surface lighting properties. However, currently Active Worlds does not support specular lighting, so setting this component has no effect. Specular lighting may be supported in a future version of Active Worlds.
### Arguments
*value* is the specular lighting value to set, but will currently have absolutely no effect.
